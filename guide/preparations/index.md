# Preparations
{: .no_toc }

A Bitcoin node is a server with which all your handy bitcoin and lightning apps interact with to privately get trusted data.

Aside from the setting up the node itself on a single-board computer, we will use the following hardware devices:
* a desktop or laptop computer
  * to talk to your node via SSH and a command line interface
  * to run browser-based apps (web apps) and desktop-based apps (desktop apps)
* a mobile phone
  * to run mobile apps
* a hardware wallet
  * for long-term cold storage of your bitcoin savings
* a home internet router
  * for the server and all your devices to connect to the local network and to the wider Internet

It is therefore important to ensure that all these devices and networks are as safe as possible to use and also protects your privacy.

In this "Preparations" section, we will go through a set of simple actions to take to harden all your devices and networks and make them more srecure and private. We'll also offer ideas on how to dive even deeper and points to optional external links.
